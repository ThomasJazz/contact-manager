# super-mailer
## Objectives
- The goal of this project is to gain experience building API's with a Java stack. Specifically, I want to learn how to use these tools/frameworks/languages
    - Java
    - Java Spring Boot
    - PostgresSQL
        - Set up a PostgresSQL database on my personal computer
        - Create some basic tables and populate them via my *Super Mailer* API

## What does the Super Mailer API do?
- Allows users to manage small e-mail distribution lists
- Users can schedule e-mails to be sent out to their distribution lists
- This is not actually intended to be used by anyone; I just created this to learn the stack
